                    &quot; I was an EMT for many years before I jonined the bootcamp, I've been looking to make a transition 
                    and have heard some people whe had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and 
                    found it incredibly fun! thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                    Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at a VR stattup.&quot;

                    &quot;The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
                    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present 
                    myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal 
                    attention you need form an incredible community of smart and amazing people.&quot;

                    &quot;Before joining the bootcamp, I,ve never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming 
                    step by step. I was encouraged ot enroll by a former student of theirs who can 
                    only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did 
                    not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learnging ot the next
                    level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it durring 
                    interview as an example of my developent exeprience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!&quot;
